## I've taken Finite Mathematics, Statistics, and Java Programming College level courses

## What I hope to gain from Computer Science:
* how to formulate a plan before trying to solve a problem
* how to know if there is a problem
* how to solve problems efficiently
* recognizing patterns in data and when to use it to your advantage
