## I've taken college level courses in Statistics, Finite Mathematics, and Java Programming

## What I hope to gain from Computer Science:
* how to formulate a plan before trying to solve a problem
* how to know if there is a problem
* how to solve problems efficiently
* recognizing patterns in data and when to use it to your advantage
